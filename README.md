# r-pkg-slides

## What?

This repo contains the slides for a talk given at a [Cabinet Office Coffee & Coding session](https://co-analysis.github.io/co-coffee-and-coding/) on 1 November 2019.

## The topic

The talk is about how to make an R package easily, with help from the {usethis} package in particular.

You can:

* [see the slides in your browser](https://matt-dray.github.io/r-pkg-slides/)
* explore the source code for the slides in this repo

## The package

In the session I'll live-build a package called {cabinet} and push it to GitHub. You'll be able to:

* look at the [source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/cabinet/)
* see the package's [website](https://matt-dray.github.io/cabinet/), made with {pkgdown}
* install the package with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/cabinet")`

But don't install it because it's silly.
